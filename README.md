Testing purposes

Hello there!

Its middle of the night in this part of the USA. 
Quite frankly I'd rather much figure out a plan for this semester or at least, learn to manage my projects on here,
prior to sleeping and starting my day.
Hence the tutorial, which I hope I am awake and well aware of what I am learning and be able to repeat or reuse
the processes for future repositories /smiley
